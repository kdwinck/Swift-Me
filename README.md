### Stretch goals

As a user I want to know what results I’ve gotten previously so that I can listen to them again.

As a user I want to be able to clear my results history so that I can

As a user I want to see a list of all the songs I’ve listened to so that I have a reference to songs I’ve listened to before.

As a user I want to see a bar chart of songs I’ve listened to and how many times I’ve listened to them so I can more clearly see my listening history

As a developer I want to include a navigation bar (does not do anything) so that the page is more functional

### Stretchy Stretch Goals
